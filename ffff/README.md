# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Install Dependencies

We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager](https://www.npmjs.com).

```
npm install
```

## Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:3000`.
